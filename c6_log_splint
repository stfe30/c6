Splint 3.1.2 --- 20 Feb 2018

c6.c: (in function main)
c6.c:5:6: Test expression for if is assignment expression: x = 6
  The condition test is an assignment expression. Probably, you mean to use ==
  instead of =. If an assignment is intended, add an extra parentheses nesting
  (e.g., if ((a = b)) ...) to suppress this message. (Use -predassign to
  inhibit warning)
c6.c:5:6: Test expression for if not boolean, type int: x = 6
  Test expression type is not boolean or int. (Use -predboolint to inhibit
  warning)
c6.c:8:2: Path with no return in function declared to return int
  There is a path through a function declared to return a value on which there
  is no return statement. This means the execution may fall through without
  returning a meaningful result to the caller. (Use -noret to inhibit warning)
